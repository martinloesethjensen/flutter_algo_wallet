# flutter_algo_wallet

Blockchain has over the past decade evolved from being simply relegated to Bitcoin, to flourishing into a vast financial network with many different utilities and use cases.
One such example is **Algorand**, which we combine with Googleâ€™s new experimental cross-development platform, **Flutter**.
We aim to make an application targeted towards Android and iOS devices with features that would enable a user to create & import wallet(s), as well as use it to send and receive tokens.
The broader point is to come to a conclusion in which we arrive with a newfound knowledge of TDD (test-driven development) and testing for specifically emerging technologies, with a smaller focus on fintech applications.
